##Algo Visualizer
Algo Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help users understand and visualize various algorithms and data structures.

Features
Algorithm Visualization:

Visualize popular algorithms such as sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort), searching (e.g., Binary Search)
Data Structure Visualization:

Walk through algorithms one step at a time to observe the internal workings and data transitions.
Interactive Interface:

Input your own data or customize parameters (like array size, initial values, etc.) to see how algorithms behave with different inputs.
Code Integration:

View the corresponding code alongside the visualization, with real-time highlighting of the code lines being executed.
Real-Time Simulation:

See algorithms in action with dynamic visual feedback, making it easier to grasp complex concepts.
